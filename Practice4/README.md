## Objective
Objective: Read, reproduce line-by-line, execute, and understand the code from Chapter 5 of the textbook. The aim is for you to learn the basics of TypeScript, which is an important modern language for web development that is becoming each time more popular in the web industry.

From Chapter 5 of the textbook, make sure to reproduce all the codes. Create a small webpage or modify the webpage that you have been developing throughout this course to demonstrate that you understand how to write simple TypeScript code. Your webpage can be about anything, as long as it is fully functional and that it includes TypeScript elements. Make sure to use arrow functions and some classes also.
