## Objective:
Read, reproduce line-by-line, execute, and understand the code of Chapter 9 of the textbook. The aim here is for you to merge together different tools and techniques that you have seen in the previous assignments and readings to build a fully functional web application, in this case, the client-side component of your own webmail system! 

## The browser
Google Chrome

## Browser version
95.0.4638.69

## Operating system
Windows 10 (version: 21H1)

## Computer architecture:
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz   2.40 GHz
RAM: 12.0 GB

# How to test my code:

###### Environment:
go into the file directory and type "npm install" in CMD to install all the packages you need.
After that,

1. use CMD:
* go into the file directory (server) and type "npm run dev", then server starts.
* open another cmd, go into the file directory (client) and  tpye "npm run build", then client starts.

2. open a web browser (chrome), go to "localhost".


###### AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

Use ajax (axios), to send http request from web client and get response from server.

And AJAX is asynchronous, this makes my web application faster.
