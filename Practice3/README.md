## Objective
Add some React components to your webpage based on the codes from Chapters 3 and 4 of the textbook. The aim is for you to get acquainted with React and how React can be used to improve significantly the user experience in more complex web applications - as you will be developing later in this course.

Using the relevant partial codes from Chapter 3 and 4 of the textbook, either modify the web page that you developed in the first assignment so you can add React components or create a new web page from scratch to demonstrate your React understanding.
